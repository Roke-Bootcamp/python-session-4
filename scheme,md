# Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python - Roke Bootcamp

## Introduction

Welcome to the Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python module of the Roke Bootcamp! In this section, we'll delve into a powerful approach for developing software called Test-Driven Development (TDD). Test-Driven Development is not just a methodology; it's a mindset that guides developers in creating robust and reliable software. Instead of writing code first and then testing it, TDD flips the process on its head. With TDD, we write tests for our code before we even write the code itself. This might seem counterintuitive at first, but it's an incredibly effective way to ensure that our code behaves as expected and remains bug-free throughout its lifecycle. By following the TDD approach, developers can catch errors early, design cleaner and more modular code, and ultimately deliver better software to end users.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and its importance in software development.
- Learn how to write test cases before writing the actual code, following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.
- Gain proficiency in using Python's unittest framework to create and run automated tests.
- Acquire practical skills in applying TDD principles to real-world Python projects.

## Detailed Scheme of Work

### Hour 1: Understanding Test-Driven Development (TDD)

#### Welcome and Overview (5 minutes)
- Introduction to the session and its objectives.

#### Introduction to TDD (15 minutes)
- **Explanation:** What is Test-Driven Development (TDD) and why it's important.
- **Examples:** Illustrating the benefits of TDD with real-world scenarios.

#### The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle (20 minutes)
- **Explanation:** Overview of the TDD cycle: Write a failing test (Red), write the code to pass the test (Green), and refactor the code (Refactor).
- **Examples:** Demonstrating each phase of the TDD cycle with code examples.

#### Setting Up unittest Framework (10 minutes)
- **Demonstration:** 
  - Installing and importing the unittest module.
  - Writing a basic test case.
- **Hands-on Activity:** Students set up the unittest framework on their machines.

#### Writing Your First Test (20 minutes)
- **Explanation:** How to structure test cases and assertions.
- **Hands-on Activity:** Students write their first test case for a simple Python function.

#### Break (10 minutes)

### Hour 2: Applying TDD in Python Projects

#### Test-Driven Development in Practice (15 minutes)
- **Explanation:** Applying TDD principles to real-world Python projects.
- **Examples:** Walkthrough of a sample project where TDD is used from start to finish.

#### Test Automation and Continuous Integration (CI) (15 minutes)
- **Explanation:** Integrating automated testing into the development workflow using tools like Continuous Integration (CI).
- **Examples:** Demonstrating how automated testing helps maintain code quality and consistency.

#### Advanced TDD Techniques (20 minutes)
- **Explanation:** Advanced TDD techniques such as mocking, parameterized tests, and test fixtures.
- **Examples:** Showcasing how these techniques enhance the effectiveness of TDD.

#### Summary and Q&A (10 minutes)
- Recap of what was learned in the session.
- Open floor for questions and clarifications.
