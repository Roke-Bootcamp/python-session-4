# Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python - Roke Bootcamp
Welcome the last session of Day 1 on your Python Bootcamp.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python module of the Roke Bootcamp! In this section, we'll delve into a powerful approach for developing software called Test-Driven Development (TDD). Test-Driven Development is not just a methodology; it's a mindset that guides developers in creating robust and reliable software. Instead of writing code first and then testing it, TDD flips the process on its head. With TDD, we write tests for our code before we even write the code itself. This might seem counterintuitive at first, but it's an incredibly effective way to ensure that our code behaves as expected and remains bug-free throughout its lifecycle. By following the TDD approach, developers can catch errors early, design cleaner and more modular code, and ultimately deliver better software to end users.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand the fundamental concepts of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and its importance in software development.
- Learn how to write test cases before writing the actual code, following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.
- Gain proficiency in using Python's unittest framework to create and run automated tests.
- Acquire practical skills in applying TDD principles to real-world Python projects.
